      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>

      <p>Something logical and creative at the same time. If that fails, coffee shop owning.</p>

      <p>On the edge of town in Phoenix, Arizona</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I used to build websites and create Flash animations in the late 2000s and early 2010s. I'd like to catch up on the technology and hopefully create bigger and better works!</p>
